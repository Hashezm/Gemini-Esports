            "*   **What Worked:**\n",
            "    *   **Horizontal Kiting:** The logic to keep the boss to one side and dash away worked well for maintaining distance.\n",
            "    *   **Combat:** The pulse-fire mechanism successfully operated the weapon.\n",
            "*   **The Critical Failure:**\n",
            "    *   **Space Gravity:** The \"Sawtooth\" pattern failed because the bot drifted upwards over time. Once the character reached the \"Space\" layer (indicated by the black sky and stars), gravity decreased significantly. The character couldn't fall fast enough to complete the downward part of the wave, got stuck against the world height limit, and became a sitting duck for the boss's attacks.\n",
            "*   **The Fix:**\n",
            "    *   **Aggressive Down-Force:** We must explicitly use `actions.move_down()` during the falling phase of the cycle to force the character down against the low gravity.\n",
            "    *   **Ratio Adjustment:** We will shorten the \"Fly Up\" duration and lengthen the \"Fall\" duration to ensure the net vertical movement is neutral or downward, preventing the drift into space.\n",
