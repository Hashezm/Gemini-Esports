      "why_static": "Unlike the blue slime body which constantly squashes, stretches, and deforms during jumping and movement animations, the crown behaves as a rigid object attached to the top. It does not distort or animate frame-by-frame, maintaining its specific shape and upright orientation at all times.",
      "why_solid": "The crown is pixel-art composed of opaque gold, red, and green pixels. Unlike the body, it has no transparency, meaning its visual appearance is not altered by the changing background behind it."
